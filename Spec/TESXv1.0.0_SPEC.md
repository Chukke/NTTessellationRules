#TESX File Spec#

#About

TESX is a portable .xml file that represents a tessellation usable in [nTpology Element Pro](http://www.ntopology.com/element-pro/). A tessellation is defined by a number of closed polyhedra & parent to child relationships between those closed polyhedra. A parent is one polyhedra, while a child is a polyhedra plus a 4x4 matrix representing an affine transformation.
